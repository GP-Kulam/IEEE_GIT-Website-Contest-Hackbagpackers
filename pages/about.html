              <h1>About Us, In Brief</h1>
              <h3>GIT Student Branch</h3>
              <p>Year of Approval: 2003<br>
                <br>
                Branch Counsellor: Prof. Abhishek Deshmukh (Asst. Professor at Dept of E&C Engineering)<br>
                <br>
                Department Chair: Dr. Santosh S Saraf (Professor and Head Dept of E&C Engineering)<br>
                <br>
                Student Branch Chair: Mr. Prasad Kadam (7th sem ECE)<br>
                

              </p> <br>
                 <p>As the popular Hindi saying goes <br>
                  <b>बूँद बूँद से सागर बनता है</b>, same is the case with IEEE GIT.
                  With just 4-5 members as active IEEE members in the year 1985, the IEEE Student Branch KLS’s GIT 
                  has grown big.As an active student branch of the North Karnataka Sub-Section, it has also helped few 
                  dormant student branches to revive itself and also guided new institutes to start a student branch. 
                  Earlier the members of the branch use to publish technical papers only. With its member strength growing, 
                  student activities and student technical symposiums were initiated. Gaining experiences from old conferences 
                  like GITCON in 90’s to INFINITY in 2004, IEEE Student Branch has come a long way in contributing to IEEE 
                  Community.<br>
                  Following are some of the Event Details..
                 </p> <br>
                   <p><b>PAANCHAJANYA</b>: GIT student branch started its annual flagship event PAANCHAJANYA from 2006. 
                    The idea of Paanchajanya was conceived with the intention of bettering the techno-managerial skills of 
                    the students. Along with this aim it is also organized with the motto- ‘EDUTAINMENT’. The word “Paanchajanya”
                     was coined by the students Mr. Anurag Agarwal and his team, which is the name of the conch of lord Krishna 
                     used in the war of Mahabharata. This conch and its sound symbolises victory of dharma over adharma, 
                     superiority of light over darkness. This annual flagship event became very popular and students across 
                     various engineering institutes of the region use to eagerly wait for this technical symposium. It is being
                      organized every year since 2006.</p> <br>
                   <b>ALL INDIA CONGRESS</b>: After establishing PAANCHAJNYA, student branch expanded its activities for the 
                   whole year. Since 2011, Student branch members are representing the institute at ALL INDIA level.<br>
                   <br>

                    MMEC Belagavi) who hosted the first North Karnataka Hub event i-GREEEN in 2013. GIT student branch holds
                    the honours of hosting the first North Karnataka Student Young Professionals WIE Congress in the year 2016.<br>

                    year 2012. Since then till 2015 SPIRITONICA has been celebrated on every Women’s Day. Since past 2 years 
                    it is named TRIGARTI and spirit of Womanhood is celebrated. Apart from this panel discussions and debate
